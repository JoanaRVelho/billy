            <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is Billy?</h3>
                <p>
                   Billy is an open source Java library which aims to provide applications with the ability to create and manage invoices.
                   One of the main goals, is the ability to export the invoices in different formats, such as SAF-T and pdf.
                   It's buid in a modular way in order to support additional country legislation, new billing artifacts as well as new export mechanisms.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Which documents does Billy support?</h3>
                <p>
                    Billy supports invoices, simplified invoices, credit notes and SAF-T (PT)
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is the difference between an invoice and a simplified invoice?</h3>
                <p>
                    Simplfied invoices are a type of inovoice that only contain the Tax Registration Number of the customer. In this type of invoice the customers' address isn't mandatory and
                    therefore suppliers only need to include its company name and Tax Registration Number.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>Does Billy support accounting properties?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the moment it does not support accounting properties. However, it's prepared to be further developed in that area.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>How is data persisted?</h3>
                <p>
                    At the moment billy uses JPA (Java Persistence API) implemented in billy-core-jpa. However, it's prepared to be extended with new APIs.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What is a SAF-T file?</h3>
                <p>
                    The Standard Audit File for Tax (SAF-T) is an international normalized file in XML format, for exchanging reliable
                    accounting data from organizations to the national tax authority or external auditors. The Standard is defined by the
                    <a href="http://www.oecd.org/">Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)</a> and it enables
                    auditors to access accounting data in an easy readable format.
                    The SAF-T file incorporates exported accounting data from an accounting system
                    for a given time period and by due to its uniform layout and
                    format it's easily readable and extensible.
                    It has been widely adopted in Europe, being extended as needed by each country in order to comply with its
                    policies and legislation.
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>What SAF-T formats are currently supported by <a href="http://premium-minds.github.io/billy">Billy</a>?</h3>
                <p>
                    In addition to the <a href="http://www.oecd.org/ctp/administration/guidancenote-guidancefordevelopersofbusinessandaccountingsoftwareconcerningtaxauditrequirements.htm">OECD</a>
                    standard, <a href="http://premium-minds.github.io/billy">Billy</a> currently supports the Portuguese format SAF-T (PT).
                    <br/>
                    You can read more about it <a href="http://info.portaldasfinancas.gov.pt/pt/apoio_contribuinte/NEWS_SAF-T_PT.htm">here.</a>
                </p>
            </div>

            <div class="question">
                <h3>How can i add a new SAF-T format?</h3>
                <p>
                    To add a new SAF-T you must extend the
                    <a href="http://www.oecd.org/ctp/administration/guidancenote-guidancefordevelopersofbusinessandaccountingsoftwareconcerningtaxauditrequirements.htm">OECD</a>
                    SAF-T to comply with the country's legislation and policies. This achieved by creating a new module that extends the billy-core module which implements the OECD standard.
                    An example of this is the Portuguese module billy-platypus.
